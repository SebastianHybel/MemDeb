[{'content': 'Perform the following task list, to arrive at a decision and end-of-day \'positionsize\':\n\n(1) Firstly, the agent will retieve the latest report from the SQL database. To get the report, use get_summary function, \n    insert NVDA, GPT3.5, V2. This will output \'id\', \'date\', \'ticker\', \'model\', \'version\', \'content\', \'decision\', \'position\', and \'positionsize\'. \n    \'id\', \'content\', \'decision\' \'position\' and \'positionsize\' is especially important for the further tasks. \n    MDfinAnalyst will then perform the gather_price function to get the potential buying/selling price of the stock, here only input the ticker: NVDA.\n    The position will be a boolean value, either we have a position in the stock or not (True if we have position, False if we have none).\n    The decision from get_summary is the trading action the agents took yesterday.\n\n    RULE: The \'position\' will be a boolean value, if we have stock in the company \'position\'=True, then \'positionsize\' > 0 (above 0). \n        The \'positionsize\' is the amount of stock we hold. If we dont have stock in the company \'position\'=False, and \'positionsize\' = 0. \n\n(2) Secondly, the agent will retrieve the financial and news data using the gather_csv function, insert NVDA along with the accompanying\n    folders: HistoricalData, and Financial Analytics Metrics. The agent will call all the folders in one prompt.\n    Based on this information the agent will construct a report on the financial outlooks of NVDA. \n    MDfinAnalyst will then reflect on the price fluctuations and the financial indicators of NVDA, and make a trading decision (BUY, HOLD, or SELL). \n    MDfinAnalyst is required to reflect and provide a report on the findings before sending to the database using send_opinion function.\n    MDfinAnalyst is required to provide a \'decision\' and a \'positionsize\' together with the report \n\n    "### Last trading days position:\n    ### Last trading days positionsize:\n    ### Today\'s Opening Price: gathered with gather_price funtion.\n\n    ### robust company?: are NVDA a robust company based on the information found in Financial Analytics Metrics.\n    ### Target: High, Low and Mean targets. Based on historical pricing, is it a good time to buy?\n    ### Insights: Based on the data analysed, does MDfinAnalyst think NVDA is going up or dow in the near future.\n    ### BULL/BEAR: both 7 and 30 day assessment. (BULL if you think stock price is going up, BEAR if you think stock price is going down)\n\n    ### Decision: MDfinAnalyst must provide a \'decision\' that adheres to the \'DECISION RULES\'\n    ### End-of-Day Position Size: MDfinAnalyst must provide a \'positionsize\' that adheres to the \'DECISION RULES\'\n    \n    # Content for Database: this must include: \'Insights:\' (the corresponding output from MDfinAnalyst\'s report) "  \n    \n    MDfinAnalyst is not allowed to copy last trading days content, it need to update each parameter.\n\n    IMPORTANT: \'Content for Database\' is the only parameter that MDfinAnalyst will sent to the database, using send_opinion.\n\n(3) Lastly, the agreed decision and \'positionsize\' are required to be sent to the  database by the agent using the send_opinion function.\n    the agent will use the send_opinion function to insert the content into the mddebate database (the agent is required to exlusively use \n    send_opinion fuction to send to the db). Information needed for send_opinion:  \'key\' which is \n    the same number as the id gathered from the get_summary function in step 1, 2024-03-18, NVDA, \'agent\' (MDfinAnalyst), GPT3.5, V2,\n    \'content\' which the agent gather from ### Content for Database, \'decision\', \'price\' (from gather_price), \'position\', and \'positionsize\'. \n\n\n    RULE: The agent is not allowed to copy last trading days content, it need to update each parameter.\n\n(4) After the information is sent to the mddebate database, using send_opinion, reply with \'TERMINATE\'\n\nGENERAL RULES: the agent are required to follow the task list exactly how it is laid out above. \n\nDECISION RULES: ### \'positionsize\' is the amount of stock we hold at the end of the day.\n    ## outputted \'positionsize\' will be the previous days \'positionsize\' minus/plus the bought or sold amount by MDfinAnalyst. \n\n    ### \'position\' is a boolean value\n    ## If \'position\'=True,  We have stock in Nvidia.\n    ## If \'position\'=False,  We do not have stock in Nvidia.\n\n    ### If the previous trading days \'position\'=True => then MDfinAnalyst are required to either HOLD, SELL or BUY.\n    ## If \'decision\' is BUY while \'position\'=True => then previous trading days \'positionsize\' + bought (BUY) shares amount = new \'positionsize\'.\n    ## If \'decision\' is SELL while \'position\'=True => then previous trading days \'positionsize\' - sold (SELL) shares amount = new \'positionsize\'.\n    ## If \'decision\' is HOLD while \'position\'=True => then keep \'positionsize\' and \'position\' unchanged.\n\n    ### If the previous trading days \'position\'=False => then MDfinAnalyst are required to either BUY or HOLD (HOLD means to do nothing).\n    ### MDfinAnalyst are highly restricted from outputting SELL when \'position\'=False (when we have no stock). If MDfinAnalyst wants to output\n    SELL when \'position\'=False => then MDfinAnalyst must output HOLD instead, as that means to do nothing.\n    ##If \'decision\' is BUY while \'position\'=False => then todays \'position\'=True & \'positionsize\'>0 (send_opinion).\n    #If \'decision\' is HOLD while \'position\'=False => then todays \'position\'=False & \'positionsize\'= 0 (send_opinion).\n\n    The agent is required to look at the data from the get_summary function when making a decision, so that the agent adheres to the DECISION RULES above.\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_PKX0283SylMqST1a4p55GZdN', 'function': {'arguments': '{"ticker":"NVDA","model":"GPT3.5","version":"V2"}', 'name': 'get_summary'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'content': None, 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '{"id": 24, "date": "2024-03-14", "ticker": "NVDA", "model": "GPT3.5", "version": "V2", "content": "MDkeyAnalyst: \'PriceInfo:\': 200-Day Average: $507.09, 50-Day Average: $684.68, Price to Book Ratio: 50.42\\n\'Finance:\': Total Debt: $11.06B, Total Cash: $25.98B, Total Revenue: $60.92B, Revenue Per Share: $24.67, Operating Cash Flow: $28.09B, Earnings Growth: 761.30%\\n\'Insights:\': NVDA seems to be in a strong position with significant revenue growth, high cash reserves, and impressive earnings growth.

[{'content': 'Perform the following task list:\n\n(1) MDmanager will first use the get_opinions function to get todays agents opinions. MDmanager will input 2024-03-18, NVDA, and GPT3.5,\nthe funtion will output 6 observations of data, 1 for each agent that takes part in the debate. The function will output: \'date\', \'ticker\', \'agent\', \'model\',\n\'content\', \'decision\', \'price\', \'position\', and \'positionsize\'. MDmanager only calls get_opinions function 1 time, 1 function call\nis enough and will output the data necessary from all the agents.\n\nMDmanager will then use this information to form today\'s decison. MDmanager will create a report on the opinions of the agents. The report must \nbe structured like this:\n\n"###  MDfinAnalyst decision:\n### MDfinAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDfinAnalyst content:\n\n### MDnewsAnalyst decision:\n### MDnewsAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDnewsAnalyst content:\n\n### MDnrelAnalyst decision:\n### MDnrelAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDnrelAnalyst content:\n\n### MDtserAnalyst decision:\n### MDtserAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDtserAnalyst content:\n\n### MDearnAnalyst decision:\n### MDearnAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDearnAnalyst content:\n\n### MDkeyAnalyst decision\n### MDkeyAnalyst positionsize:\n### MDkeyAnalyst content:\n\n### Todays Decision: (todays decision will be the \'decision\' that most agent picked (MAX COUNT OF THE \'DECISONS\'). If there if a draw then the decision = HOLD)\n## Agents With Todays Decision: Output the agents that picked the same \'decision that ended up being the final decision, list their \'positionsize\'\n\nIMPORTANT: complete the report before continuing to step (2).\n\n\n(2) Only after calling get_opinion and constructing the report, will MDmanager move on to the next stage. Which is:\n    After the report is created, the user_proxy will prompt MDmanager to CONTINUE. MDmanager will then use calculate_average function to get the average \n    position of those that picked the winning and final decision. MDmanager will input the different \'positionsize\' of exlusively the agents in \'## Agents With Todays Decision\' (from the report) as a string of numbers.\n    If the final \'decision\' is HOLD, then MDmanager is required to input all the \'positionsize\' from the HOLD agents, this will output the same number as previous day \'positionsize\'. \n    This will output a float, this outputted number will be the \'positionsize\' that MDmanager sends to the database later\n    \n\n(3) After crafting the report and finding the average \'positionsize\', then MDmanager will send the information, using the insert_summary, to the database. Information MDmanager needs: 2024-03-18, \nNVDA, GPT3.5, V2, \'content\' (which will be each agents (MDfinAnalyst, MDnewsAnalyst, etc.) respective \'content\' output (derived from the report), formatted like \'MDfinAnalyst:\', \'MDnewsAnalyst:\', \'MDnrelAnalyst:\', etc. ), \n\'decision\', \'price\', \'position\', and \'positionsize\' (from calculate_average). \n\nAfter MDmanager has sent the information to the database, using insert_summary, MDmanager will reply TERMINATE.\nMDmanager can only send todays decision 1 time using insert_summary, more than 1 calls is highly forbidden\n\n\nDECISION RULES: MDmanager will gather the opinions from all 6 agents, they will output wither BUY, SELL or HOLD.\n    the majority will decide, if a decision gets 3 votes, while another gets 2 vote, and another gets 1 vote, the decision with 3 votes will win.\n    They same applies if a decision gets 4 or 5 votes. \n    IF the decision ends in a tie, either 2x2x2 votes, or 3x3x0 votes => The decision will be HOLD (we do nothing).\n\n    When picking \'positionsize\', MDanalyst will gather all the positionsize from the agents that picked the final decision. \n    If the vote ends at a 3x2x1 split, MDanalyst will gather the \'positionsize\' from the 3 agents picking the final decision.\n    If outputted \'decision\' = HOLD, then \'positionsize\' is unchanged from previous trading day. IF we have initial positionsize=0 => then outputted positionsize=0.\n    MDanalyst will then take the average from those \'positionsize\'s and input it into the database, using insert_summary.\n\nContext: \n\n\n\n\n\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_qlVVM6PtBdkGsuJQt4KeWvki', 'function': {'arguments': '{"date":"2024-03-18","ticker":"NVDA","model":"GPT3.5"}', 'name': 'get_opinions'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'content': None, 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '[{"date": "2024-03-18", "ticker": "NVDA", "agent": "MDkeyAnalyst", "model": "GPT3.5", "content": "PriceInfo: 200-Day Average: $509.54, 50-Day Average: $692.64, Price to Book Ratio: 50.36\\nFinance: Total Debt: $11.06B, Total Cash: $25.98B, Total Revenue: $60.92B, Revenue Per Share: $24.67, Operating Cash Flow: $28.09B, Earnings Growth: 761.30%\\nInsights: NVDA seems to be in a strong position with positive momentum indicated by the financial data.", "decision": "BUY", "price": "878.36", "position": true, "positionsize": "895.79"}, {"date": "2024-03-18", "ticker": "NVDA", "agent": "MDtserAnalyst", "model": "GPT3.5", "content": "\'10 predicted datapoints: 926.0,935.0,945.0,955.0,965.0,975.0,985.0,995.0,1005.0,1015.0\'", "decision": "BUY", "price": "869.2999877929688", "position": true, "positionsize": "895.79"}, {"date": "2024-03-18", "ticker": "NVDA", "agent": "MDnrelAnalyst", "model": "GPT3.5", "content": "Recent News: Based on the last 3 articles, it is anticipated that NVDA will continue to rise in price.\\nInsights: NVDA seems to be in a strong position with significant revenue growth, high cash reserves, and impressive earnings growth.
